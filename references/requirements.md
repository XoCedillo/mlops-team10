### Barrokas Inn Hotel and Restaurant

Barrokas Hotel & Suites is a 4-star hotel built in 2008, with a modern contemporary design and services aimed at guests visiting this border city for business. Currently, they have only implemented a chatbot on their website and have not approached any other Machine Learning projects.

After the interview, the client mentioned that a model to help predict cancellations would be very useful, but what they are most interested in is a revenue forecasting model to better plan logistics and purchases based on high seasons.

Another concern the hotel has is the competition against hotel chains, as they compete for the industrial tourism market. They would like to explore options where a model could help plan a marketing strategy specifically targeting the Maquiladora industry and the Industrial sector of the region. Their ultimate goal is to offer a membership program with benefits for loyal customers.

Given the direct impact on revenue and operational efficiency, I recommend starting with a Cancellation Prediction Model. This model can provide immediate benefits by reducing revenue loss and allowing the hotel to take preventive measures. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for more complex models like revenue forecasting and dynamic pricing.

Below are proposals with their commercial impact, data availability, and actionable information:

1. **Cancellation Prediction Model:**
   - **Commercial Impact:** Predicting cancellations can help the hotel take proactive measures to minimize revenue loss.
   - **Data Availability:** The dataset contains relevant features such as lead_time, is_canceled, deposit_type, days_in_waiting_list, and reservation_status_date.
   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can implement strategies like offering discounts or upgrades to guests who are likely to cancel.

2. **Revenue Forecasting Model:**
   - **Commercial Impact:** Accurately forecasting revenue can aid in budget planning, resource allocation, and strategic planning.

   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can adjust pricing strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and manage inventory based on forecasted revenue.

3. **Customer Segmentation Model:**
   - **Commercial Impact:** Understanding different customer segments allows for personalized marketing, improved customer satisfaction, and increased loyalty.
   - **Data Availability:** Features like customer_type, adults, total_of_special_requests, reservation_status, agent, and company provide a basis for segmentation.
   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can tailor services and offers to specific segments, enhancing the customer experience.

4. **Dynamic Pricing Model:**
   - **Commercial Impact:** Dynamic pricing helps maximize revenue by adjusting prices based on demand and other factors.

   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can dynamically adjust room rates to optimize occupancy and revenue based on demand forecasts.

5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Model:**
   - **Commercial Impact:** Predicting CLV helps identify high-value customers and optimize marketing efforts.
   - **Data Availability:** Features like customer_type, adr, stays_in_weekend_nights, stays_in_week_nights, and total_of_special_requests are pertinent.
   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can focus on retaining high-value customers through targeted loyalty programs and personalized services.

### Hampton Inn by Hilton Piedras Negras

The Hampton Inn hotel chain is one of the hotel chains in the city, known for hosting mainly high-profile clients and often being the venue for political and industrial meetings. It is not interested in transient tourism through the city and is positioned as a hotel with logistical advantages and luxury service. It offers many benefits to its customers and all kinds of facilities such as being pet friendly, digital check-in, and a membership program.

Given that the clientele demographics are very segmented, the management's interests are to exploit these identified demographics, reduce logistics and supply costs, reduce process costs, and exploit the market for social and business events.

Since a significant percentage of their income comes from VIP guests, the administration emphasized their interest in the Guest Experience Improvement Model. This model is innovative, directly impacts guest satisfaction, and effectively leverages existing data. It offers personalization, which is a significant trend in the hotel industry, and can differentiate the hotel in a competitive market.

Below are the proposals the client expressed interest in, along with their commercial impact, data availability, and actionable information:

1. **Guest Experience Improvement Model:**
   - **Objective:** Predict and personalize the overall guest experience based on historical data and preferences.
   - **Commercial Impact:** Improving the guest experience can lead to greater satisfaction, positive reviews, and repeat visits.
   - **Data Utilization:** This model can leverage features like total_of_special_requests, required_car_parking_spaces, lead_time, customer_type, adults, and even past booking history if available.
   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can use the model's predictions to personalize room settings, prepare personalized welcome packages, and offer specific services (e.g., spa appointments, dining reservations).

2. **Sustainability and Resource Optimization Model:**
   - **Objective:** Predict and optimize resource usage (e.g., energy, water) based on booking patterns and guest behavior.
   - **Commercial Impact:** Promotes sustainability, reduces operational costs, and improves the hotel's eco-friendly image.
   - **Data Utilization:** Features like stays_in_weekend_nights, stays_in_week_nights, lead_time, adults, and total_of_special_requests can help predict resource needs.
   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can adjust HVAC settings, manage water usage, and optimize cleaning schedules based on guest occupancy patterns.

3. **Event and Activity Recommendation Model:**
   - **Objective:** Recommend local events and activities to guests based on their preferences and booking details.
   - **Commercial Impact:** Enhances the guest experience by providing personalized recommendations, leading to higher satisfaction and potential revenue from partnerships with local businesses.
   - **Data Utilization:** Features like arrival_date_month, adults, customer_type, and total_of_special_requests can inform recommendations.
   - **Actionable Information:** The hotel can offer tailored activity suggestions (e.g., family events, nightlife, tourist tours) and create personalized itineraries for guests.
