# Step-by-Step Guide to Setup

## 1. Install Conda
If you haven't already installed Conda, you can download and install Miniconda (a minimal Conda installer) or Anaconda (which includes more packages by default):

- **Miniconda (Recommended for most users):**
  
  Download Miniconda from the official website: [Miniconda Installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

  Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

- **Anaconda:**
  
  Download Anaconda from the official website: [Anaconda Installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

  Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Now you have Conda installed and ready to use. You can create environments, install packages, and manage your Python projects efficiently.



## 2. Create a New Conda Environment
Once Conda is installed, you can create a Conda environment specifically for this project. This helps isolate project dependencies from other projects on your system:

- **Create the Environment:**

   This will create the environment using `environment.yml` file:
   ```bash
   make create_environment     
   ```


- **Activate the Environment:**

   Activate the newly created environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate mlops-bootcamp-team10
   ```

Now, your terminal prompt should indicate that you are working within the `mlops-bootcamp-team10` environment.


## 3. Install Packages
Now that your environment is active, you can start installing packages required for your project.  All you need to do is update the contents of your `environment.yml` file accordingly and then run the following command:

```bash
make requirements
```
